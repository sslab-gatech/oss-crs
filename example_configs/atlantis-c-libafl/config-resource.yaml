# Resource Configuration for CRS Deployment

# Worker definitions - specify available resources on each worker
workers:
  local:
    cpuset: "0-15"  # Taskset CPU list
    memory: "16G"

# Global LLM configuration (applies to all CRSs combined)
# These are TOTAL limits that will be divided among CRSs
llm:
  max_budget: 10  # Total budget in dollars for ALL CRSs
  max_rpm: 1200    # Total requests per minute, each CRS could go up to this
  max_tpm: 1000000 # Total tokens per minute, each CRS could go up to this

# CRS-specific configurations
# If a CRS is not listed here, it will get an even share of remaining resources
crs:
  # Fine-grained configuration example
  atlantis-c-libafl:
    # Worker placement - CRS will be deployed to these workers
    workers:
