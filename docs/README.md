# OSS-CRS Documentation

Welcome to the OSS-CRS documentation. This guide covers everything from getting started to building your own Cyber Reasoning System.

For a quick introduction and setup instructions, see the [project README](../README.md).

---

## Getting Started

| Topic | Description |
|---|---|
| [Quick Start](../README.md#quick-start) | Install prerequisites and run your first CRS in minutes |
| [CRS Development Guide](crs-development-guide.md) | Build or integrate your own CRS into the OSS-CRS framework |
| [CRS Registry](registry.md) | Browse available CRSs ready to use out of the box |

## Configuration Reference

| Config File | Description |
|---|---|
| [CRS Compose (`crs-compose.yaml`)](config/crs-compose.md) | Orchestration config — define CRS entries, resources, and ensemble campaigns |
| [CRS (`crs.yaml`)](config/crs.md) | Per-CRS config — prepare, build, and run phases for a single CRS |
| [Target Project (`project.yaml`)](config/target-project.md) | Target project setup — OSS-Fuzz format and `project.yaml` schema |
| [LLM (`litellm_config.yaml`)](config/llm.md) | LLM provider setup — model routing, API keys, and custom endpoints via LiteLLM |

## Architecture & Design

| Document | Description |
|---|---|
| [Architecture Overview](design/architecture.md) | System design, component diagram, and lifecycle walkthrough |
| [libCRS](design/libCRS.md) | CRS communication library — submit/fetch seeds, PoVs, and patches |
| [LiteLLM Integration](design/oss-crs-infra/litellm.md) | LLM proxy, per-CRS API keys, and budget enforcement |
| [Seed Deduplication](design/oss-crs-infra/seed-dedup.md) | Cross-CRS seed deduplication service (planned) |
| [PoV Deduplication](design/oss-crs-infra/pov-dedup.md) | Crash verification and deduplication service (planned) |
| [WebUI](design/oss-crs-infra/webui.md) | Monitoring dashboard for campaigns (planned) |

## Key Concepts

### CRS Lifecycle

Every CRS campaign follows three phases managed by `crs-compose`:

1. **Prepare** — Pull CRS source repositories and build Docker images (`crs-compose prepare`)
2. **Build Target** — Compile the target project and run each CRS's target build pipeline (`crs-compose build-target`)
3. **Run** — Launch all CRSs and shared infrastructure via Docker Compose (`crs-compose run`)

### CRS Isolation

Each CRS runs in its own containerized environment with strict resource boundaries:

- **CPU** — Pinned to specific cores via `cpuset`
- **Memory** — Hard memory cap via `mem_limit`
- **LLM Budget** — Per-CRS dollar-denominated limits enforced by LiteLLM
- **Network** — Private Docker network per CRS; shared network for infrastructure access

### Ensemble Campaigns

Multiple CRSs can be composed in a single `crs-compose.yaml` to run simultaneously. Each CRS operates independently with its own resource allocation, and results are aggregated automatically.
