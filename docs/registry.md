# CRS Registry

The **CRS Registry** is a curated catalog of certified open-source Cyber Reasoning Systems that are compatible with the OSS-CRS framework. Each registered CRS has been verified to follow the [CRS Development Guide](crs-development-guide.md) and can be used out of the box with `crs-compose`.

## Registry Structure

Each CRS in the registry is defined by a `pkg.yaml` manifest located under `registry/<crs-name>/`. The manifest describes the CRS metadata and where to fetch its source:

```yaml
name: <crs-name>
type:
  - bug-finding              # and/or bug-fixing
source:
  url: <git-repository-url>
  ref: <branch-or-tag>
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `name` | Unique identifier for the CRS |
| `type` | List of CRS capabilities — `bug-finding`, `bug-fixing`, or both |
| `source.url` | Git repository URL containing the CRS implementation |
| `source.ref` | Git branch or tag to use |

## Available CRSs

### Currently Registered

| CRS | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **crs-libfuzzer** | bug-finding | A lightweight CRS that runs libFuzzer on the target. Good starting point and baseline for evaluation. |
| **atlantis-multilang-wo-concolic** | bug-finding | A multi-language LLM-powered CRS that generates and refines fuzz harnesses without concolic execution. |

### Planned

The following CRSs are planned for inclusion in the registry:

| CRS | Status |
|---|---|
| 42-patch-agent | Planned |
| atlantis-c-bullseye | Planned |
| atlantis-c-deepgen | Planned |
| atlantis-c-libafl | Planned |
| atlantis-claude-code | Planned |
| atlantis-java-atljazzer | Planned |
| atlantis-java-main | Planned |
| atlantis-multi-retrieval | Planned |
| atlantis-prism | Planned |
| atlantis-vincent | Planned |
| buttercup-patcher | Planned |
| swe-agent | Planned |

## Using a Registered CRS

To use a CRS from the registry, reference it in your [compose file](config/crs-compose.md) and run:

```bash
# Prepare the CRS
uv run crs-compose prepare --compose-file <compose-file>

# Build the target
uv run crs-compose build-target --compose-file <compose-file> --target-proj-path <target-path>

# Run the CRS
uv run crs-compose run --compose-file <compose-file> --target-proj-path <target-path> --target-harness <harness>
```

See the [Quick Start](../README.md#quick-start) for a complete walkthrough.

## Adding a CRS to the Registry

To register a new CRS:

1. Ensure your CRS follows the [CRS Development Guide](crs-development-guide.md).
2. Create a directory under `registry/` with your CRS name.
3. Add a `pkg.yaml` manifest with the required fields.
4. Submit a pull request for review.
