# OSS-CRS: Open Source Cyber Reasoning System Framework

**OSS-CRS** is a standard orchestration framework for building and running LLM-based autonomous bug-finding and bug-fixing systems (Cyber Reasoning Systems).

## Why OSS-CRS?

- **Standard CRS Interface** — OSS-CRS defines a unified interface for CRS development. Build your CRS once following the [development guide](docs/crs-development-guide.md), and run it across different environments (local, Azure, ...) **without any modification**.
- **Effortless Targeting** — Run any CRS against projects in [OSS-Fuzz](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz) format. If your project is compatible with OSS-Fuzz, OSS-CRS can orchestrate CRSs against it out of the box.
- **Ensemble Multiple CRSs** — Compose and run multiple CRSs together in a single campaign to combine their strengths and maximize bug-finding and bug-fixing coverage.
- **Resource Control** — Manage CPU limits and LLM budgets per CRS to keep costs and resources in check.
- **Multi-Environment Support** — Run locally today; deploy to Azure (coming soon) with zero changes to your CRS.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version |
|---|---|
| Python | >= 3.10 |
| Docker | latest |
| Git | latest |
| [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) | latest |

### 1. Prepare a Target Project (OSS-Fuzz Format)

OSS-CRS works with any project that follows the [OSS-Fuzz](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz) project structure. Clone the OSS-Fuzz repository to get started:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:google/oss-fuzz.git ~/oss-fuzz
```

> **Tip:** You can also prepare your own target repository as long as it is compatible with the OSS-Fuzz project format.

### 2. Run a Simple Bug-Finding CRS

The example below uses **crs-libfuzzer**, a lightweight CRS that runs libFuzzer on the target.
See [`./example/crs-libfuzzer/crs-libfuzzer-compose.yaml`](example/crs-libfuzzer/crs-libfuzzer-compose.yaml) for the full configuration.

```bash
# Prepare the CRS (pull images, set up dependencies)
uv run crs-compose prepare \
  --compose-file ./example/crs-libfuzzer/crs-libfuzzer-compose.yaml

# Build the target project
uv run crs-compose build-target \
  --compose-file ./example/crs-libfuzzer/crs-libfuzzer-compose.yaml \
  --target-proj-path ~/oss-fuzz/projects/libxml2

# Run the CRS against a specific harness (e.g., "xml")
uv run crs-compose run \
  --compose-file ./example/crs-libfuzzer/crs-libfuzzer-compose.yaml \
  --target-proj-path ~/oss-fuzz/projects/libxml2 \
  --target-harness xml
```

### 3. Run an LLM-Powered CRS

For a more advanced CRS that leverages LLMs, you can use **atlantis-multilang**. This CRS supports multiple languages and uses an LLM to generate and refine fuzz harnesses.
See [`./example/multilang/multilang-compose.yaml`](example/multilang/multilang-compose.yaml) for the full configuration.

```bash
# Prepare the LLM-powered CRS, for example, multilang
uv run crs-compose prepare \
  --compose-file ./example/multilang/multilang-compose.yaml 

# Build the target
uv run crs-compose build-target \
  --compose-file ./example/multilang/multilang-compose.yaml \
  --target-proj-path ~/oss-fuzz/projects/libxml2 

# Run the CRS
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<OPENAI_API_KEY>
export GEMINI_API_KEY=<GEMINI_API_KEY>
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<ANTHROPIC_API_KEY>
uv run crs-compose run \
  --compose-file ./example/multilang/multilang-compose.yaml \
  --target-proj-path ~/oss-fuzz/projects/libxml2 \
  --target-harness xml
```

> **Note:** LLM-powered CRSs require an LLM API key. Refer to [docs/config/llm.md](docs/config/llm.md) for configuration details.

### 4. Run an Ensemble of Multiple CRSs

Combine multiple CRSs in a single campaign to get the best of each approach. Simply define them in an ensemble compose file
 For example, [`./example/ensemble/ensemble-compose.yaml`](example/ensemble/ensemble-compose.yaml) launches both **crs-libfuzzer** and **multilang** simultaneously. Check the compose file for detailed configuration.

```bash
# Prepare 
uv run crs-compose prepare \
  --compose-file ./example/ensemble/ensemble-compose.yaml 

# Build the target
uv run crs-compose build-target \
  --compose-file ./example/ensemble/ensemble-compose.yaml  \
  --target-proj-path ~/oss-fuzz/projects/libxml2 

# Run the CRS
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<OPENAI_API_KEY>
export GEMINI_API_KEY=<GEMINI_API_KEY>
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<ANTHROPIC_API_KEY>
uv run crs-compose run \
  --compose-file ./example/ensemble/ensemble-compose.yaml  \
  --target-proj-path ~/oss-fuzz/projects/libxml2 \
  --target-harness xml
```

Each CRS runs independently with its own resource allocation, and results are aggregated automatically.

## Build Your Own CRS

OSS-CRS is designed to make CRS development simple. Follow the [CRS Development Guide](docs/crs-development-guide.md) to package your bug-finding or bug-fixing tool as a CRS. Once integrated, your CRS will:

- Work with any OSS-Fuzz-compatible target
- Run in any supported environment (local, Azure, ...) without modification
- Be composable with other CRSs for ensemble campaigns
